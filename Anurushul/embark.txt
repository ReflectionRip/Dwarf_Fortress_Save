You said you wanted a challenge? Get inside quick, and hope you find metal. Another place where you're wanting to build with 1 layer between the surface and your first level (to prevent trees from putting holes in the roof), then every 5 below it (so you don't end up with 100 layers between where you are and where you want to be mining, and so you can add stuff later). Trade depot out front, then a large space for training soldiers (probably storage when you first move in, then everything else downstairs. Farms may have to go downstairs and then back up to find soil, but you want to be able to close the main doors if there are too many enemies and you need to close off part of the fortress.

The leader is worthless at anything but bookkeeping and trading, but letting them talk to other dwarves should help keep people happy, and help them build trading skills.

The mason is a back-up soldier. The smith is also one of the miners, so consider making the axe first, and choosing someone as a woodcutter (nobody has the skill).

Mica is your maga-safe stone. You start with 1 tin and 1 copper, so you can make 2 bronze bars for 2 picks. You don't have a leatherworker, but choosing someone and making some basic armor will help the soldiers when they train.

I think there are only 2 caverns, and the second one should have water.

You also probably want someone to make the milk into cheese, to increase your food stocks so you can make it until the farms are going. Butcher one of the unpaired animals if you need more food early on, and you can make soap from the tallow.

Oh, there are also necromancers out, so you'll want the dump away from the entrance (or inside the volcano), and will eventually move it indoors with a chimney.
